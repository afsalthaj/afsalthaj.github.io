# S.O.L.I.D

## Why learn this?

I like Apple's theorem, that "there is always a better way" - a nice little thought that can influence your solutions to any problem. 
As Software Engineers, our solution is going to be a `Software` ..mostly....
Hence, there is always a better `Software`. Let's make ourselves capable of finding that better one efficiently.

#### Characteristics of a design 
The engineered design can be intuitive,  simple, specific to a problem or scalable with in that problem domain, stays 
with in a preferred boundary of the use-case and so forth..and so forth. <br>
Oh! what does that mean? - "Simple", "intuitive design", "scalability" and "boundary" >>  We will discover the essence
of these terms fairly quickly.

#### Where do you stand and how do principles help?
Many a times, you might have already done things that sticks to some formalised principle, which you never thought was something written
formally in a white paper. Example: if you wrote a function `buyCoffee` without mentioning anything about `chargeCreditCard`, and returns just a cup of `Coffee`, 
that simply shows your design of `Cafe` probably follows lots of principles already. You could call it, "less dependency", or "purely functional" or "no side effects", 
or "easy to test"...whatever... </br>

First thing is, realising where you stand even if you don't know these principles in theory. Ask yourself "Have I done such beautiful code by any chance?".
If you think the answer is "may be" or "yes", or at-least the above cafe problem makes sense to you, that basically shows you have already got the required dots scattered across
your space of design thinking. The formalised principles that we are going to learn just connects those dots - and that's it! 
 
Stories behind, let's understand I of SOLID.
 
## Interface Segregation principle.

Let us design a ATM.
An ATM has transactions. A transaction can be WithdrawalTransaction, DepositTransaction, TransferTransaction etc. Next, 
we have a UI for ATM, and UI can be Braille UI, Screen UI and Speech UI. Different `transactions`
can speak to UI methods to publish their message, however, the message might differ based on a transaction.
If you have a single UI interface having `RequestTransferAmount`, `RequestDepositAmount` that can work with all the types
of transactions, the problem is kind of solved. And you made it working. But.... what you did is a quick solution, and not a smart solution.
If you already know of a code smell, that's pretty good!

The problem is, a type of transaction, say DepositTransaction, can enforce a change to UI interface to add a new functionality, which would further lead to
changes in all the other transactions that extended the same UI. In short our the problem is: 

"A change in UI for solving a problem  with`DepositTransaction` resulted in changes with `TransferTransaction`. Hence, the design doesn't make any sense"

It seems like we need a UI for Withdraw, Deposit and Transfer.i.e, DepositUI, WithdrawUI and TransferUI. 

First stage of Solution: 
* All Transaction classes extend Transactions as expected. 
* We have separate DepositUI, WithdrawUI and TransferUI that gets mixed into `UI`. 
* A particular transaction won't work with `UI` since it is already fatty. You should be knowing what that possibly means.
* All transactions can then be provided with its corresponding `UI` type as given below.
directly. 

Intent of doing this, clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.

So, here we go: A part of the solution:

{% highlight java %}

interface DepositUI {
    public int requestDepositAmount();
}

interface WithDrawUI {
    public int requestWithDrawAmount();
}

interface UI extends DepositUI, WithDrawUI {
    
}

interface Transaction {
    public void execute();
}

class DepositTransaction implements Transaction {
    private DepositUI ui;

   public DepositTransaction(DepositUI ui) {
        this.ui = ui;
   }
    
   public void someCommonTransactionMethod(){
        // ..some implementation
   }

   public void execute() {
        ui.requestDepositAmount();
    }
}

class WithDrawTransaction implements  Transaction {
   private WithDrawUi ui;

   public WithDrawTransaction(WithDrawUi ui){
        this.ui = ui;
   }

   public void execute() {
     ui.requestWithDrawAmount();
   }
}

{% endhighlight %}

You may note that, DepositTransaction must know about DepositUI. Withdraw Transaction must know about WithDrawUI. As you can see,
we solved this problem by making the constructor of each type of transaction expecting the right type of UI. We could pass in the UI
as given below

{% highlight java %}

class ATM {

   UI gui;  //global object;

   DepositTransaction dt = new DepositTransaction(gui);
}

{% endhighlight %}
